Programming Projects in C language

## Inventory Project
The system maintains product data, allows for insertion and deletion of items from the list and enables searching for product details by name as well as code. The list is displayed in sorted order by product code.

## Process Control Block
Process Control Block (PCB) is a multitasking operating system which manages multiple processes in the memory at a time. The system has attributes such as process name, process ID, process priority, and a link to the next process. PCB allocates and de-allocates memory dynamically to processes and performs operations like creation, insertion, deletion, traversal and search.

## Tic Tac Toe 2-player
The program facilitates a tic-tac-toe game between 2 players.

## Travelling Salesperson- Graph- Dijkstra Algorithm
Consider the map of certain region. A sales person want to travel from one city to another city. He is trying to find the shortest path amongst available paths. He enters the source city and the destination city. The program helps him find the shortest path upon application of the Dijkstra Algorithm. The distance matrix is computed and a record of the visited nodes is maintained.

<br/>Input: A Graph (Adjacency Matrix) and Source city
<br/>Output: Shortest Distance with Path from source city to destination city.
